        How Much Water Should You Drink?

You’ve probably heard the "8 glasses a day" rule, but it’s not quite that simple. We’ll break it down in a way that makes sense for you. There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to hydration—it depends on things like your activity level, the weather, and your body size. For example:

    If you’re active (like working out or playing sports), you’ll need more water to replace what you sweat out.
    If you’re just chilling at home or working a desk job, you might need a bit less.
    If you’re in a hot climate or it’s summer, you’ll need more water to stay cool.

We’ll help you figure out how much water is right for you, so you never have to guess again.
