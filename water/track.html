        <h2>Tracking Your Water Intake</h2>
        <p>Staying on top of your water intake can be a challenge, but there are plenty of tips and tricks to make it easier. One simple method is to use a reusable water bottle with markings on it to help you track how much you've drunk throughout the day. This provides a visual cue and helps you stay accountable. You can also set reminders on your phone or use a hydration app to prompt you to drink water at regular intervals. These small nudges can help ensure you're consistently meeting your daily hydration goals.</p>

    <p>Another effective strategy is to create a water-drinking routine. Try drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning, before meals, or after exercise to make hydration a natural part of your day. Some people find it helpful to pair water intake with other habits, such as drinking a glass every time you check your email or after finishing a task. Keeping track of your progress through a journal or app can also motivate you to stay consistent and notice patterns in your hydration habits. Additionally, you can make tracking your water intake more enjoyable by infusing your water with fruits, herbs, or natural flavorings. This not only enhances the taste but can also make you more likely to reach for your water bottle throughout the day. For those who struggle with plain water, adding slices of lemon, cucumber, or mint can provide a refreshing twist, encouraging you to drink more. Using a marked water bottle or app in combination with flavored water can make the process both fun and effective, making it easier to hit your hydration targets without feeling like a chore.</p>
